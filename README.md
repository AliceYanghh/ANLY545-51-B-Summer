We will be reviewing the following paper [Classification Performance of Neural Networks Versus Logistic Regression Models: Evidence From Healthcare Practice](https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.22443).

# Summary

The goal of this assignment is to:

1. Individually read and review the paper.
   As a group, please summarize your thoughts including the following:
   * How original is the topic?
   * What is the main question addressed by the research?
   * Are the conclusions consistent with the evidence and arguments presented?
2. Pretend that ChatGPT (or similar tool) is a new team member.
   Ask ChatGPT to contribute to the group project.
   Keep diligent notes as to your conversation.
   Science is about reproducibility, if your classmates can not repeat the process using your steps, you will be marked down in the _next_ assignment.
3. Compare and contrast what you, as a human team member, _understood_ to what ChatGPT, as an A.I. team member, _understood_.
   Did ChatGPT help fill in your understanding of the paper?
   Did ChatGPT miss the mark in a meaningful way?

# Reproduction

The core of science is reproducibility.
This goes back hundreds of years to the [Royal Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Society).
We must be able to reproduce our work and the work of others.

The goal of this assignment is to:

1. Reproduce the work, **exactly as presented**, of the group that came before you (see People in Canvas).
2. Evaluate if the result (identical or different) are still useful.
   * Did **the other team's** prompts help fill in **your** understanding of the paper?
   * Did **the other team's** prompts miss the mark in a meaningful way?

Due to the nature of how Generative AI (an the English language for that matter), a question can be answered differently even a couple of hours later.
Differing answers to get to the same prompt are not necessarily _wrong_, but they **must be noted**.
Once you know where grandma's house is, there are a lot ways to get there.
