Remember to write your thoughts as a book report.
I expect the same _content_ as your presentation, but the working should reflect the new medium.

The core of science is reproducibility.
This goes back hundreds of years to the [Royal Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Society).
We must be able to reproduce our work and the work of others.

# Reproduction

Reproduce the work, **exactly as presented**, of the group that came before you (see People in Canvas).

# Evaluate

Evaluate if the result (identical or different) are still useful.

1. Did **the other team's** prompts help fill in **your** understanding of the paper?
2. Did **the other team's** prompts miss the mark in a meaningful way?
